# 🎬 Browsing Load Test Report: Read-Heavy Operations

This report summarizes the performance test results for the **Browsing User Journey** (`02-browsing-load.js`), which was designed to test the application's ability to handle high concurrency of read-heavy endpoints.

The test used a ramping load profile, peaking at 120 concurrent Virtual Users (VUs) over 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

## 🎯 Test Objective and Configuration

| Setting | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scenario** | `browsing_simulation` (Ramping VUs) |
| **Peak Load** | **120 VUs** |
| **Total Duration** | 2 minutes 30 seconds |
| **Target URL** | `http://localhost:8080` |
| **Purpose** | Test API speed and stability under load for core user browsing tasks (Movie Listings, Showtimes, Seat Maps). |

## ✅ Overall Performance Summary: PASS

The application **passed all defined performance thresholds** with a significant margin. The system maintained perfect stability and low latency throughout the entire load profile.

| Metric Category | Threshold Goal | Result | Assessment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Error Rate (`http_req_failed`)** | `< 1%` | **0.00%** | **PASS.** Zero request failures. |
| **Overall Latency (p95)** | `< 1000ms` | **30.41ms** | **PASS.** Excellent response time well below the 1-second SLO. |
| **Total Iterations** | N/A | **1,111** | Completed user journeys. |
| **Data Integrity Checks** | N/A | **100.00%** | All checks (status code, JSON validity, data presence) passed. |

## 📈 Conclusion and Next Steps

The application handles the simulated **Browsing Load Test** flawlessly. The read path is highly optimized, demonstrating minimal latency and zero errors even at the peak load of 120 VUs.

### Recommendations:

1.  **Stress Test Capacity:** Given the low latency, immediately re-run the test with a **significantly increased target VU count (e.g., 500 VUs or more)** to find the true capacity ceiling of the application's read endpoints.
2.  **Focus on Writes:** The next critical phase must be to test **write operations** (seat locking, seat booking, payment) which will stress the database transactionality and concurrency mechanisms. This will determine the system's stability under load.
